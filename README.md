# Advent of Code 2021 - BK - Kotlin

This repo contains my code solution for the Advent of Code coding challenge (https://adventofcode.com/)
for the year 2021 #aoc-2021-in-kotlin

## Important Note

In each day package I have also included a `sebaig` package containing the code solution from 
Sebastian Aigner (https://github.com/SebastianAigner) which I will take as the **BEST** solution for the
code and I have duplicated into my own repo for my own learning purposes.

I will first complete each challenge on my own and then go to Sebastian's repo (https://github.com/SebastianAigner/advent-of-code-2021)
to compare my solution against his and learn from his approach!
